# Simple Interest Calculator

This repository hosts a simple script to calculate simple interest, developed as a part of a micro-finance startup's initiative to provide financial tools to low-income individuals. This project is the first step in migrating our codebase from SVN to Git and embracing open-source best practices.

Input:
   p, principal amount
   t, time period in years
   r, annual rate of interest
Output
   simple interest = p*t*r
